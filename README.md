List of stuff to do!
make password/username editable?
TPM????????? a lot to consider here.
add aes-256, maybe 128 for low power devices.
SALTS!!!!! DAWG HOW DID YOU FORGET
salt and encrypt the salt so you can have salt on your salt while you salt your salt. we have fun.
add prompt to set decryption key and database file names (with custom extension) on first use for obscurity
remove master password from .py code, should be salted and encrypted as well.
salt and encrypt final files for security? do you do that for open source projects??
this thing needs to be secure even with the source code fully transparent.
